            An animal is a living creature belonging to the biological kingdom Animalia, characterized by being multicellular,
            eukaryotic, and having the ability to move, eat, and reproduce, unlike plants which produce their own food. 
            Animals exist in a vast diversity of forms, from microscopic to giant whales, 
            with the two major categories being vertebrates (having backbones) and invertebrates (lacking backbones).
